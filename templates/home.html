                <p>Angular 2 is an open source JavaScript framework to build web applications in HTML and JavaScript.
                    This tutorial looks at the various aspects of Angular 2 framework which includes the basics of the
                    framework, the setup of Angular and how to work
                    with the various aspects of the framework. Other topics discussed in the tutorial are advanced
                    chapters such as interfaces, nested components and services within Angular. Topics such as routing,
                    modules, and arrays
                </p>
                <p>The user should be familiar with the basics of web development and JavaScript. Since the Angular
                    framework is built on the JavaScript framework, it becomes easier for the user to understand Angular
                    if they know JavaScript.

                <p>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable
                    network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight
                    and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time
                    applications that run across distributed devices.</p>
                <p>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and
                    networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the
                    Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.</p>
                <p>Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development
                    of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.</p>

                <p>React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
                    application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data
                    changes.
                </p>
                <p>Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.</p>
                <p>Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data
                    through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

                <p>Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue
                    is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the
                    view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate
                    with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of
                    powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and
                    supporting libraries.
                </p>
                <p>If youâ€™d like to learn more about Vue before diving in, we created a video walking through the core
                    principles and a sample project.
